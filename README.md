# pong
My attempt at making pong in processing

## Current Problems
* I can't seem to get this thing to export
* I really want to rewrite most of the code, this thing was done in like 3 hours on a weekend ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
* Not really a problem but I just wanted to point out this is my first github repo


## Installation
If you don't have Windows, make sure you have Java installed as well as for any computer make sure you have at least Processing 3.3.5 (What version I used when making it) 

## Links

* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) This is processing's brain sortof, kind of needs this to work

* [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) Yea and you also need this too

## Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank the people at the [processing discord](https://discord.gg/gY2D67Z) for helping me with some issues, such as the paddle movement.
